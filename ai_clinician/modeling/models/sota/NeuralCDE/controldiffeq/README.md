# controldiffeq

The mathematical theory of controlled differential equations is largely concerned with _rough controls_, which are quite hard to integrate.

Fortunately, their practical application here doesn't need that, so we can use existing tools! In particular, we can use the [`torchdiffeq`](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) library.

We've wrapped it up into this tiny `controldiffeq` library, that:
+ Computes natural cubic splines from data with missing values.
+ Wraps around `torchdiffeq.odeint[_adjoint]` to make computing CDEs a bit easier.

### Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/patrick-kidger/NeuralCDE.git
```

Note that installation shouldn't be necessary for use from the experiments folder. (The code there does some path-hacking to import it instead.)

### Basic usage
Compute natural cubic splines:
```python
from controldiffeq import natural_cubic_spline_coeffs, NaturalCubicSpline
# Preprocess data (potentially with missing values) before training
coeffs = natural_cubic_spline_coeffs(times, data)
# coeffs is a tuple of tensors you can feed through PyTorch Datasets and DataLoaders
...
# Inside your model
spline = NaturalCubicSpline(times, coeffs)
```

Then solve the controlled differential equation driven by the data:
```python
from controldiffeq import cdeint
# Inside your model
result = cdeint(dX_dt=spline.derivative, z0=..., func=..., t=times[[0, -1]], adjoint=True)
```

### Documentation
The library provides the `cdeint` function, which solves the system of controlled differential equations:
```
dz = f(z)dX     z(t_0) = z0
```

The goal is to find the response `z` driven by the control `X`. For our purposes here, this can be re-written as the following differential equation:
```
dz/dt = f(z)dX/dt     z(t_0) = z0
```
where the right hand side describes a matrix-vector product between `f(z)` and `dX/dt`.

This is solved by
```python
cdeint(dX_dt, z0, func, t, adjoint=True, **kwargs)
```
where `dX_dt(t)` is a Tensor of shape `(..., input_channels)`, `z0` a Tensor of shape `(..., hidden_channels)`, `func(z)` is a Tensor of shape `(..., hidden_channels, input_channels)` and `t` is a one-dimensional Tensor of times. The adjoint method can be toggled with `adjoint=True/False` and any additional `**kwargs` are passed on to `torchdiffeq.odeint[_adjoint]`, for example to specify the solver.

The other part of this library is a way of constructing natural cubic splines from data (potentially with missing values):
```python
natural_cubic_spline_coeffs(t, X)
```
where `t` is a one-dimensional Tensor of shape `(length,)`, giving observation times, , and `X` is a Tensor of shape `(..., length, input_channels)`. This will compute some coefficients of the natural cubic spline, and handles missing data, and should be done as a preprocessing step before training a machine learning model. It returns a tuple of four Tensors which you can pass into Datasets and DataLoaders as normal. During training, this can then be understood by your model:
```
spline = NaturalCubicSpline(t, coeffs)
```
and then `spline.derivative` passed to `cdeint` as described above.
